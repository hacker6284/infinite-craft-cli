# Changelog

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- **File locking** for concurrent access — multiple CLI processes can safely share the same `discoveries.json` (e.g. web terminal sessions). Uses `fcntl.flock` on Unix, gracefully skipped on Windows.
- **`INFINITE_CRAFT_DATA` env var** — override the default data directory (`~/.infinite-craft-cli/`) for custom deployments.
- **Shared HTTP client** — Infinibrowser requests now use `curl_cffi` with Chrome impersonation (same as the neal.fun API client), replacing the old `urllib` implementation. Better Cloudflare compatibility.
- **`fetch_json()` helper** — cached, sync HTTP fetcher with Chrome impersonation, available for reuse.

### Changed
- `storage.py`: `add()` now re-reads from disk before writing, so concurrent processes don't miss each other's additions.
- Removed `urllib.request` dependency from CLI module.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- Initial stable release.
- Replaced `infinite-craft` PyPI dependency with direct `curl_cffi` usage.
- Own `Element` dataclass, `DiscoveryStorage`, `RateLimiter`, and `InfiniteCraftClient` modules.
- `--version` flag.
- All interactive commands available as non-interactive subcommands: `recipe`, `import`, `export`, `fill`, `unfilled`, `exhaust`, `crawl`, `permute`, `cross`.
- Retry with exponential backoff on API errors.
- Windows compatibility: `readline` guarded, signal handling fallback.
- 162+ unit tests via Bazel, integration test suite against real API.
